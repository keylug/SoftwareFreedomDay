# SoftwareFreedomDay
Parent folder for materials related to each year's Software Freedom Day

Please use the following filenaming convention: Prefix each new file with "SFD" followed immediately (no spaces anywhere in the filename) by the year and a hyphen; then provide the descriptive name of the file. Example: "SFD2016-ItemsToBring" (the use of camelCase should help readability).
