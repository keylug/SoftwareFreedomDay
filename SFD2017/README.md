SFD 2017
Wednesday, September 6, 2017
11 AM to 2 PM

This year we will be at Frederick Community College, at the student Center.
The date will be different from the international Software Freedom Day to be able to meet several hundred students as they return to campus for the new semester.

Please if you can, print a nominal amount of copies (e.g. 10 cys) of the PDF files in this folder (except no need to duplicate the QR codes one -- that will be for those visitors who want to just snap the code and read the material later, or in case we run out of hard copies).

I will bring a heavy duty extension cord and a couple of power strips.
There will be WiFi in case you want to demo something online.

Please let us know what you are bringing, so we can be sure to plan table space for it.

For those who can break away on work day, we'll see you there!

Thanks,
Mark
