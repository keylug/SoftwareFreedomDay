# Items to Bring, and who is bringing them

FAQ: 
Q. What should I bring?
A. Something that can be displayed on part of a standard long folding table together with other projects also displayed
on the table. This could be something that you have on your laptop screen or monitor turned for the public to see. It also
could be a Raspberry Pi-like project, or an item (poster, etc.) that you can explain how open source was used to produce it.
It helps greatly to know how much is planned for display so we can arrange for table space for all your excellent projects.
Q. What if I have no projects to demo or display?
A. Come anyway! :-) Besides hanging out, you can certainly talk with people who are interested about open source.
Also, it will help greatly for all to print a few copies (~10) of the following files in this (SFD2018) folder, as follows:
Open-source-cookies-recipe.pdf
OpenSource-References.pdf
SFD-2Sided-one-sheet-2018.pdf (print this 2-page document on single sheet double sided if possible)
Q. Will there be electric power available?
A. Yes, we will have an extension cord with power strips attached. Best to bring your own power strip if you have more than one
device needing power (don't forget about keeping your mobile phone charged!).
Q. Will there be Internet?
A. Yes, the FITCI WiFi should reach to the sidewalk where we'll be set up. Ask for the access info when you're there.
